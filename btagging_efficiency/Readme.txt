Event_selection is where the jets are selected from raw ntuples according to the same kinematic cuts on leptons and jets. The output root file is the input for b-tagging efficiency mapping.

btagging_eff.py generates efficiency root file by reading the output from
event selection. The input directory is specified in the code.
